## Supply Chain Greenhouse Gas Emission Analysis

## Project Overview

This repository contains an analysis of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with various sectors of the economy. The dataset provides detailed insights into both direct emissions and those associated with supply chain margins, measured in terms of CO2 equivalent per monetary unit spent (2021 USD). The goal of this project is to help businesses, policymakers, and researchers understand the environmental impact of economic activities across different industries and identify opportunities for improving sustainability.

## Objectives

1. Identify industries with the highest GHG emissions per dollar spent.
2. Analyze trends in emissions over time and model future scenarios.
3. Evaluate the emission efficiency of industries.
4. Provide insights for lifecycle assessment studies and low-carbon investment strategies.

## Data Sources and Tools Used

### **Dataset:** Supply Chain Greenhouse Gas Emission Dataset

### **Tools Used:**

- Microsoft Excel: Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Power BI Desktop: Data visualization and dashboard creation

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### **Data Description**

The dataset contains key attributes that define GHG emissions across different sectors. The key columns include:

- **Industry Sector**: Name of the industry sector
- **CO2 Equivalent per Monetary Unit**: GHG emissions measured in CO2 equivalent per 2021 USD
- **Supply Chain Margins**: Margins associated with supply chain emissions
- **Total Emissions**: Total GHG emissions including supply chain margins

## Methodology

### **Data Cleaning & Preparation**

- Handled missing values and standardized data formats.
- Created calculated fields for total emissions and emission margins.
- Grouped industries by emission levels and analyzed their performance.

### **Data Analysis in Excel**

- Used Pivot Tables to summarize emission trends by industry sector.
- Analyzed average emission levels across different sectors.
- Examined the relationship between total emissions and supply chain margins.

### **Visualization & Insights in Power BI**

- Built an interactive dashboard summarizing key findings.
- Created bar charts to compare emissions by industry sector.
- Analyzed trends in emissions over time and modeled future scenarios.
- Evaluated emission efficiency of industries.
